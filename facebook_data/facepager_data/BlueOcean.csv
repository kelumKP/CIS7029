That’s according to research by Moody’s Investors Service Ltd, which says almost 13% of British borrowers could face financial distress if the UK sees high-single-digit inflation next year, alongside an aggressive rise in interest rates.   In contrast, the impact of rising rates on European nations such as Spain, Italy and France will be softer given their high share of long-term, fixed-rate loans. In these nations, a large share of floating interest rate loans have been gradually written off, having originated from periods of historically high interest.  Since then, mortgage borrowers in Spain and Italy have largely moved away from floating loans due to low interest rates, helping to shield portfolios from rising costs. In the UK, the spectrum of borrowers is broader, meaning they are more vulnerable to inflationary pressures.  Residential mortgages are in the firing line from inflation and interest rates because rate hikes used to combat surging prices increase borrowers’ costs. Inflation is likely to peak in 2022, but commodity price shocks driven by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could amplify pressures and uncertainty, Moody’s said.",,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0
