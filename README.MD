Real Estate industry is another essential area need to improve along with the population growth. As for living standards getting improve, this area needs to improve parallelly. I’d like to select Prime Group as for the company. When considering property market Prime Group is one of major player.

There are few large and small competitors for Prime Group presently, such as, Home Lands, Blue Ocean, CBH Lands, Sky Line and HouseAndLandsLk companies.

Based on following Real State Companies in Sri Lanka against Revenue and Employees table, it is showing other major players and their revenues in this business.
